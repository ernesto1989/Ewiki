# EWiki Project

## This project is currently under development

This project is currently under development.

Starting date: July 7 2024  
Version: 0.9: July 12 2024 -> Just a few steps behind the first release


## What is this for 

First things first: 
 
 As part of my jurney as a part-time professor at the School of Science and Enginerring @Tec de Monterrey, I have been constantly motivated to start coding again.
 I refused having a bad time learning complex frameworks such as those in Java and .Net when I started coding back in the day. I was taking a frontend bootcamp that used
 NodeJs for backend development, and I realized it was ok for me to just let it go. It doesn't mean that I think those complex frameworks in Java and .Net are wrong, just I don't have enough time to code that way.

 Motivation:

 1. I have been strugguling with my taking notes process. So that's why I started a Personal Wiki Project.
 2. This project has helped me to reinforce a few concepts in my programming skills.
 3. Just for fuckin fun

 ### Tools
 1. NodeJS runtime environment (Express and Ejs)
 2. W2UI for some basic functionalities and widgets
 3. Bootstrap
 4. SQLite
